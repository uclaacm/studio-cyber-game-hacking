# Studio x Cyber Game Hacking
A repository of "hackable" Unity games for use in Studio x Cyber collabs.

Here's our current line up:
- **Invaders:** a simplified version of [*Fusion*](https://str0nkyk0ng.itch.io/fusion), a GMTK 2021 submission from Aaron/Aidan
- **Karting:** Unity's [kart racing microgame project](https://learn.unity.com/project/karting-template)
